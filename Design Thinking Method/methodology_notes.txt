Methodology Notes

This study employs a qualitative conceptual research design conducted through desk research.
No primary data collection, surveys, interviews, or experiments were undertaken.

The analysis is structured using the Design Thinking framework, consisting of five stages:
empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. These stages are applied as an analytical lens
to interpret existing literature and documented case studies related to digital education
and educational equity.

Data sources include peer-reviewed journal articles, policy reports, and institutional
publications focusing on digital learning, education access, and sustainable development.
The case of Bridge International Academies is used as a comparative reference due to its
documented application of technology-supported education in underserved contexts.

Analytical procedures involve thematic synthesis and mapping of key issues, strategies,
and insights from the reviewed sources to the stages of the Design Thinking framework.
This process supports the development of a conceptual framework adapted to the Indonesian
context.

These notes are provided to document the analytical logic of the study and to support
conceptual reproducibility.
